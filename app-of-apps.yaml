      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).

    - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation

    - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true # Only sync out-of-sync resources, rather than applying every object in the application
